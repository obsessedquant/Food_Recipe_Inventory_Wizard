# Starving Student

This project is meant to take an inventory of food items and return what is the highest percent match of recipes that you could use to make a meal.

It will identify which items you need to buy at the store and output a .csv grocery list.

The user will be able to filter by which food items they have and which food items they don't have or do not wish to buy.

It uses a combination of SQL databases, web scrapers, Python calculation and data cleanup code, and JavaScript front end web development.
